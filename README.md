# Adiabatic-Logic-An-Alternative-Approach-To-Low-Power-Application-Circuits
Over the last few decades, integrated circuit technology has fuelled enormous development in the electronics industry. Power dissipation has become a serious concern as the use of portable electronic devices has grown. It may become increasingly difficult to supply cooling as the density and size of the chips in the system rise, resulting in a considerable increase in the system's cost. That is why, even when numerous components are integrated on a single chip, we require circuitry that reduces power dissipation. In a digital CMOS circuit, we want to decrease power dissipation. To decrease power dissipation, several approaches are employed. The circuit is energy is regenerated in adiabatic logic, whereas energy is squandered in other techniques. 

There are two types of adiabatic logic: partly adiabatic and fully adiabatic. Some of the circuits are power is squandered in partly adiabatic logic circuits. Energy is regenerated in completely adiabatic circuits (all charges are recovered). We use PFAL (positive feedback adiabatic logic), a partly adiabatic logic, to mimic mux, sum, and adder in this project.
